## 📚 Learning Value

This project was my **first official JavaScript project** 🎉

* It helped me understand the **basics of JavaScript**, such as:

  * DOM manipulation (`querySelector`, `addEventListener`)
  * Conditional logic (`switch`, `if/else`)
  * Error handling with `try...catch`
  * Regular expressions for input validation
* Also improved my **HTML & CSS knowledge** by building a modern, frosted-glass styled UI.

Building this calculator gave me confidence in working with **JavaScript fundamentals** and taught me how to connect logic with user interaction.
